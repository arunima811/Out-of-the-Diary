# What the Hell Is Going On?? 
## (A doubtful Poem.) #NotAtAllArtistic #NonsenseOrSense  

I need to write down how am I feeling </br>
But also, do what I am doing. </br>
Tussles between the two worlds is quite exhaustive. </br>
I want to stay and get attached, I want to run away and leave. </br>
I want to tell them ‘I love them’ and see them getting old, </br>
Also, want them to carry me along, take care of me, and be strong. </br>
I am in-between choosing Phineas-and-Ferb and Rick-and-Morty, </br>
At the age between choosing Bojak or ThisIsUs. </br>
Lol! Was that shallow or cheezy? </br>
Did you cringe? </br>
Should I cringe?</br>
Am I okay?</br>
Um... Are you Okay? Vs. Do you know I’m not Okay? </br>
I want to grow up and stay small.</br>
Is this the 20’s mid-life crisis no one told me about?</br>
Who Should have told you? Whom did you ask?</br>
Oops! I am dumb... or…</br>
So, what! everyone Is. You go Girl! **Giggles**.</br>
Everything has become about balancing the extremes.</br>
All my certainties have mellowed.</br>
I don’t even know if I should be happy about it or sad.</br>
Maybe this is somewhere in between the sad and happy.</br>
Maybe it has passed either sad or happy, </br>
it’s moved forward towards the- end of the ‘Inside-out’ merger.</br> 
Between a lot of maybes there has come an acceptance of doubt.</br>
Growing up is probably a getting sorted </br>
Or is it being okay with the doubt? </br>
