```
I, weeping out,
beneath the black clouds
Yelled, asking my life to tell me the reason
of its partial undulations.
It came running,
scared, as if lost every euphoria
hugged me tightly and said
Don't you believe? I'll let my girl reach its destination.

Tears rolled down my throat,
I burst out saying-
Why! Did you make your elite dust away?
Why! Every trust and criteria, climbing troughs
do prove the result as loath?

Life consoled 
The failureâ€™s flux
lead to the bridges high.
Deflecting dark lead to the straight rays of light.
I trusted you the most
Thus, gave you most of the stones.
You will find diamonds in them 
As an adroit.

Today, when I look back at it,
it makes me believe.
No matter how many gains we lose,
it's about every relation that helps you move ahead and every experience you reveal.
Live it all
Cry out
Move on, And 
Have a fight with life.
The fight may make it feel
But leaving it to the destiny will give you nothing.
