```
I weeping out,
beneath the black clouds
Yelled, asking my life to tell me the reason
of it's partial undulations.
It came running,
scared, as if lost every euphoria
hugged me tightly as asked_
Don't you believe? I'll let my girl reach it's destination.

Tears rolled down,
I burst out saying-
Why! Did you made your elite dust away?
Why! Every trust and criteria, climbing troughs
prove the result as loath?

Life consoled that faliure's flux
lead to the bridges high.
Deflecting dark lead to the rays of light.
I trusted you the most
Thus gave you most of the stones.
You will find diamonds in them as an adroit.

Today, when I look back at it,
it makes me believe.
No matter how many gains we lose,
it's about every relation that helps you move ahead and every experience you reveal.

Live it all
Cry out
Move on
Have a fight with life.
That fight may make it feel
But leaving it tot the destiny will give you nothing.
Just kick out the petty stones in your path
And tell them
Tell them that
What's waiting for me
Is that highest peak.
